PayBill Manager (work-in-progress üë∑üîßÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚õè)
-------------------
Paybill manger is an Android app meant to help you manage your bill.

It attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 2
 * Uses all of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/): Room, LiveData and Lifecycle-components
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection

## Project Setup

First off, you require the latest Android Studio 3.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

## API Keys
For the app to make requests you require a [Safaricom Dev Account](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/ ). Once you have one, go ahead and [create an application](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/user/1079/apps/add) in order to get your credentials

Once you have it, open `gradle.properties` file and paste your API key in `SAFARICOM_CONSUMER_KEY` and `SAFARICOM_CONSUMER_SECRET` variables respectively.

## RoadMap
- [x] Setup Travis CI
- [x] Add Kotlin Support
- [x] Create payment module
- [x] Add CodeCov
- [ ] Setup CodeQuality Checks
- [ ] Setup LeakCanary
- [ ] Release Beta Version
